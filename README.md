This is a game made using the 'turtle' library in python. The turtle module provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and procedure-oriented ways. It can be used to make simple games like this very simple yet fun snake game classic. You can use the "left", "right", "up", and "down" arrow keys to control direction. The code itself is pretty self-explanatory, with comments provided wherever i thought things got confusing. You can copy-paste this code into your code-editor/shell, play around with it, and have some fun- change colours, increase/decrease difficulty levels, change sizes of characters- anything using your own imagination!
